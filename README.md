# Module_13_Challenge

To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, created a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

Prepared the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model
Using the Pandas and scikit-learn's StandardScaler() to compile and evaluate the neural network model later. 
Encoded the dataset's variables using OneHotEncoder then placed the variables into a new DF

Compiled and Evaluated a Binary Classification Model Using a Neural Network
Designed a binary classification deep neural network model. Made 3 layers of aside from the original. 
Compiled and fit the model.
Evaluated the model to calculate the loss and accuracy. 

Optimized the Neural Network Model
Optimized the model to improve the model's accuracy. 
Displayed accuracy scores from each model. 
Saved each model
